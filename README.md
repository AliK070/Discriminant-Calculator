# Discriminant-Calculator
### 2024/04/20
A simpler way for calculating the discriminant of a given set of values for b, a, and c, using the quadratic equation.
## How to use it:
Using the discriminant calculator is relatively simple, first extract the file and than run the setup.exe. From there you can use the application, and will see the following interface:

From here you can enter your given b, a and c values into the fields. After doing so click on the calculate the button, which will process your given inputs. After processing, it will display the answer of these values and it will also display the number of solutions. 

For example if

`b = 2`

`a = 1 `

`c = 2`

than the answer will yield -4, which is `b^2 - 4ac > 0`, thus there is only one solution to this given set of data.

A few settings that have been implented are features such as dark mode, toggle the answer label and solution label. The last setting is to do with graphs. It displays an example of how the number of solutions is reflected onto a graph.
